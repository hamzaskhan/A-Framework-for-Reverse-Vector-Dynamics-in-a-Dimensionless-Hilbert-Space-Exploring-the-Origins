## Project Description
This repository provides the code, documentation, and experimental data for the paper titled **"A Framework for Reverse Vector Dynamics in a Dimensionless Hilbert Space"**. The research introduces the **Reverse Vector Dimensionless Hilbert Space (RVDH)** framework, exploring the origins of the universe and multidimensional transitions. The model introduces **Dimensional Entropy (Λ)** as a scalar to represent dimensional evolution and transition. By incorporating chaos theory, the framework simulates both expansion and collapse dynamics within a quantum Hilbert space.

## Methodology
Our approach leverages quantum computing (via Cirq) to simulate the evolution of entangled qubits in the RVDH framework, with entropy as a marker for dimensional transitions. Linked qubits represent entangled states, with state changes visualized as either expansion or collapse. The patterns in entropy during these transitions provide insight into the chaotic nature of dimensional evolution.

### Key Steps in the Methodology:
1. **Dimensional Expansion and Regression**: Simulating qubit entanglement dynamics to reflect dimensional growth (expansion) and reduction (collapse).
2. **Entropy Calculation**: Calculating entropy at each stage to observe oscillatory behavior as (Λ) changes.
3. **Chaotic Dynamics**: Analyzing chaotic patterns in entropy relative to dimensional transitions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.8+
- **Cirq** (for quantum computing simulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)

### Recommended Skills
- Basic knowledge of quantum computing
- Familiarity with Python
- Understanding of Hilbert space and chaos theory

## Experimentation
The experimentation code includes:
- **Entropy Measurement in Expansion**: Entropy is recorded for each quantum state iteration to observe dimensional growth.
- **Entropy Measurement in Collapse**: Entropy is calculated as qubits return to initial states, simulating collapse.

## Results and Discussion

### Key Findings
1. **Dimensional Expansion and Regression**: Entropy changes correlate with expansion and collapse phases, reflecting dimensional dynamics.
2. **Chaotic Entropy Patterns**: Oscillatory patterns in entropy highlight chaotic behavior and non-monotonic dimensional transitions.
3. **Role of Entanglement**: Increasing entropy in entangled states suggests complex multidimensional evolution.
