## Project Description
This repository provides the code, documentation, and experiments for the paper titled **"A Framework for Reverse Vector Dynamics in a Dimensionless Hilbert Space"**. The research proposes a new theoretical framework, the **Reverse Vector Dimensionless Hilbert Space (RVDH)**, to conceptualize the universe's origin and explore multidimensional existence. The model introduces **Dimensional Entropy (\(\Lambda\))** as a scalar representing dimensional evolution and transition. By incorporating chaos theory, the framework simulates expansion and collapse dynamics within a quantum Hilbert space.

## Methodology
Our approach uses quantum computing (Cirq) to simulate the evolution of entangled qubits within the RVDH framework, with entropy serving as an indicator of dimensional transitions. The entangled states are represented by linked qubits, with changes in their states visualized as either expansion or collapse. The entropy patterns during these transitions provide insight into the chaotic nature of dimensional evolution.

### Key Steps in the Methodology:
1. **Dimensional Expansion and Regression**: Simulating qubit entanglement dynamics as dimensional growth (expansion) and reduction (collapse).
2. **Entropy Calculation**: Calculating entropy at each stage to observe oscillatory behavior as \(\Lambda\) changes.
3. **Chaotic Dynamics**: Examining chaotic patterns in entropy as a function of dimensional transitions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.8+
- **Cirq** (for quantum computing simulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for data visualization)
  
### Recommended Skills
- Basic understanding of quantum computing
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of Hilbert space and chaos theory

## Experimentation
The experimentation code includes:
- **Entropy Measurement during Expansion**: Entropy is measured and recorded in each quantum state iteration.
- **Entropy Measurement during Collapse**: Entropy is calculated as qubit states revert, simulating dimensional collapse.
  
To adjust experiment parameters like the number of qubits or steps in \(\Lambda\), edit the `config.json` file in the root directory.

## Results and Discussion
### Key Findings
1. **Dimensional Expansion and Regression**: The entropy values correlate with expansion and collapse phases.
2. **Chaotic Entropy Patterns**: A periodic, oscillatory pattern in entropy indicates chaotic dynamics and suggests a non-monotonic behavior in dimensional transitions.
3. **Entanglementâ€™s Role**: Entanglement increases entropy, indicating complex multidimensional evolution.
